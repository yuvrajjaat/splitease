# SpliteEase

A bill-splitting application to track shared expenses in a group, developed with Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and React.

## Explanation of Transaction Minimization Algorithm

We implemented a greedy algorithm to minimize the number of transactions required to settle the debts between all members of a group when the user toggles 'Smart Split'. The algorithm runs in **O(n log n)**, where **n** is the number of usersâ€”this ensures scalability as the number of users increases.

A simple example of this algorithm is shown below. In this example, Alice owes Bob $10, and Bob owes Charlie $10 for a total of two transactions. The algorithm will suggest that Alice pays Charlie $10 directly, reducing it to one transaction.

For larger groups, the optimization becomes even more significant. The following diagram demonstrates a scenario where six users initially have six transactions. The algorithm reduces this to only four transactions.
